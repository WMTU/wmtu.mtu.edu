__FCC and the Law__

These laws have life and death consequences for WMTU. Know them, love them, live them. Seriously, the FCC can levy fines that are in the five figure category. If we get busted for breaking one of these laws MTU will close us down and probably sue you as well-- get it? Oh yeah, you can also forget any hopes of ever broadcasting for or anyone else. In recent years, the FCC has changed its rules governing non-commercial/educational radio (this is the category into which falls) and no longer require our DJ's to be licensed. This in no way means that their regulations are any more lenient or penalties less severe than in previous years.

__Indecency/Obscenity Guidelines:__ DEFINITION "language or material that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs."

In 1978, George Carlin brought down the wrath of the FCC when his album George Carlin, Operation: Foole was broadcast. In his album he used shit, piss, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, fuck, asshole, and tits. Those words are now prohibited and serve as a generic definition of indecency. You cannot say or play these Pacifica Words.

__If you say a Pacifica Word__ you face penalties both from as well as the Federal Government. Please be aware that Section 1464 of the U.S. Criminal Code states: "Whoever utters any obscene, indecent, or profane language by means of radio communications shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than two years or both. Penalty: Warning to immediate and permanent dismissal.

__Indecency__: You cannot play a song or any other recorded material that contains one of the seven dirty words. If you accidentally play a song containing an indecency you must activate the 6 second delay bypass button (a.k.a. "The Oh Shit" button" after the first occurrence, but you must fade it out after a second occurrence. Make sure that you note the song as a "Do Not Play" by marking the ID label and the sleeve. If the offending word makes it out over the air, then note the song, disc ID number, and time of occurrence on the Discrepancy Log-- this will save you from any penalties. Penalty: Warning to immediate and permanent dismissal.

__Obscenity__: The FCC deems a song obscene if it is "patently offensive and offers no political, cultural, artistic, or social value." Please use your best judgment to what should be appropriate to play. 's Broadcast Supervisor is the final authority on obscenity. All appeals to the Broadcast Supervisor's decision will be placed with the General Manager for General Staff review. Penalty: Warning to immediate and permanent dismissal.

__Underwriting:__ is a non-profit educational radio station, therefore we raise money by allowing businesses to sponsor portions of our broadcast. has binding contracts with sponsoring companies, by signing the DJ log you certify that you and have fulfilled our side of the contract. Try to run underwriting spots within three minutes of the scheduled time. After playing the spot, make sure you write the actual time of broadcast in the comments section of the DJ log. Penalty: Warning to dismissal for remainder of the term.

__Copyright Infringement:__ Anything broadcast over the air is considered a public performance and copyright laws must be considered. Reading excerpts from plays, poems, or novels will constitute a copyright infringement unless the DJ obtains permission from the author or publishing company. Other offenses include: re broadcasting another station's signal, broadcasting a syndicated radio show without permission or at a time of than that which is agreed upon, broadcasting sound recorded from copyrighted television shows or movies. Bootleg recordings of bands may not be broadcast without written consent of the band.

By sending a disc or album to us the publisher has implied that we have the right to broadcast the material. 's library can be broadcast without fear of breaking the law. Penalty Warning to dismissal for remainder of the term.

__Top of the hour legal ID:__ The FCC requires that every FM station identify themselves within five minutes of each top of the hour with their call letters and city of origin. A legal top of the hour would include ", Houghton" or "Houghton, " intact within the sentence. An example would be, "You're listening to , Houghton, the only station that matters." The Programming Director and Production Manager will be determining specific liners that we will ask you to use for mid-hour ID purposes. Any identification other than top of the hour is not required by law, but suggested as a way to keep your listeners interested and informed. After completing a legal ID, make sure you initial the proper spot on the DJ log. Penalty: Warning to dismissal for remainder of the term.

Never identify the station using incorrect or someone else's call letters. This is a "false communication," a major infraction. Penalty: Immediate and permanent dismissal

__Call  to Action:__ The FCC forbids a non commercial station such as ourselves from issuing "calls to action." A DJ issues a call to action when he/she asks, urges, or suggests that the listener should perform some task which may result in a for-profit organization making money. This rule does not apply to non-profit organizations, like itself or, let's say, the Save Our Springs Coalition. Calls to action include:

1.  Urging a listener to buy a record.
2.  Urging the listener to go to a concert or other  performance.
3.  Mentioning the price of a record or concert ticket.
4.  Urging the listener to patronize a specific club  or record store.
You are free to rave about how great an album or band is; that's only a "review." However you cannot rave about a business establishment, (i.e., "Sam Goody is a great record store"). That counts as a commercial.

Please note the phrases must refer to a specific band, club, record, etc. Non-profit organizations like are the only entities you can specifically urge people to spend money on. You can, and are encouraged to tell people to attend a benefit for or purchase items (bumper stickers, T-shirts). In short, if it directly makes or another non-profit organization money, it's okay. Otherwise, it's a call to action. Examples of what are and aren't calls to action:

*   "Here's the new single from MC Roach Penis. Check it out"; Fade up new MC Roach Penis single on turntable one. - This is OK. You're just pre-announcing.
*   In your air break: "The new Doomicial demo is available at Sam Goody and Sound Exchange" - not a call to action (pure information).
*   In your air break: "The new Doomicial demo is available at Sam Goody and Sound Exchange, the best record stores in Houghton." -a call to action (using superlatives for a business establishment).
*   In your air break: " The new Doomicial demo is available at Sound Exchange for 4 dollars" - a call to action (mentioning price).
*   In your air break: "Go check out The Poster Children at the /USG Benefit. Cover's only $5!" - OK only because it's two non-commercial organizations.
*   In your air break: "Led Zeppelin is the  greatest band in the world" - not a call to action.
*   "Wilco is fantastic live and is coming here  to Houghton for Spring Fling" - still not a call to action.
*   "I will definitely be at the Wilco show..." - still not a call to action.
*   "...and I want you to be there too." - now it's a call to action.

__Penalty:__ One warning to  permanent  dismissal.

__Defamation  of Character-Slander:__ Slander is "communication which exposes a person to hatred, ridicule, or contempt, lowers him in the esteem of his fellows, causes him to be shunned, or injures him in his business or calling". The rule of thumb for this one is that whatever you say about someone had better be true or absolutely provable. As well, the person you're mentioning must be a public figure who is fair game for such commentary. Examples: "Bill Clinton is transvestite and a necropheliac." - fair game since the president is a public figure, but you better have pictures to prove the statement. Don't say anything without proof! "My friend's roommate, Jack Onan, masturbates six times a day while looking at pictures of donkeys." Jack can sue you and out the wazoo--he'll have been slandered (assuming Jack is not this way) plus he's not a public figure. Also see invasion of privacy below. Penalty: one week suspension to permanent dismissal as well as referral to the Dean's office (as see fit)

__Invasion  of privacy:__ Giving out unlisted phone numbers, full names, or other personal, private information about a person without their permission is an invasion of their privacy. Invasion of privacy also occurs when you tell a story about someone (to avoid slander) and that person is not a public figure. Penalty: One warning to permanent dismissal.

__False  Information:__ It is illegal for you to transmit "false or deceptive communications by radio." Example: "Hi your listening to and I just wanted you to know that Martians have just invaded the U.S. I'm serious, dudes." This is another rule the FCC is really serious about. Penalty: One warning to permanent dismissal.

__Editorializing:__ Editorializing means going out of your way to express your opinion about a matter other than the music your playing, such as telling the audience your beliefs on abortion. Editorializing is OK, but keep these things in mind: 1) FCC rules prohibits non-commercial stations from endorsing political candidates; 2)You must ensure that it is clear to the audience that what you are saying is your opinion, not that of as a whole or MTU, by playing the 'editorial disclaimer' minidisc at the end of any spiel you may go on; and 3) Try not to bore the audience with overly long political soliloquies. While we want you to express yourself, keep in mind that the listeners might not be as interested in your opinions as you are. Think of the editorial disclaimer minidisc as your DJ Opinion Condom. It protects and MTU from any legal problems from the FCC or other folks. The Broadcast Supervisor is the final authority on what is or is not editorializing. Editorializing without playing the editorial disclaimer minidisc:Penalty: One warning to permanent dismissal.

__DJ Logs:__ DJs must correctly fill out the programming log, a written record of our on-air signal. The first important thing to do on these logs is to sign in for your shift. All 24 hours of our broadcast day should be signed for, or the FCC gets very upset when they ask to look at our logs (which they can do at any time). While you are signed on, you are responsible for all the equipment and recorded material in the control room and any damage resulting from theft, vandalism, food, drink, and smoke. The programming logs also list various things you need to announce (Legal ID, PSA's, promos, etc.). DJs must record the actual time these items are announced in the space provided. The legal ID is an FCC requirement. The others are programming items and are discussed later.

Falsification of the logs (i.e. knowingly recording the playing of a PSA when it was not actually played), is an extreme no-no. If you can't fulfill an obligation on the log (because a minidisc is missing) note that on the programming log. Noting the problem on the log fulfills your responsibility and someone who knows what they're doing will take care of it. Failure to properly fill out logs:Penalty: One warning to permanent dismissal.

__Watching  the VU meters:__ The VU meters are the left and right channel needle-monitors on the control board which show the overall loudness of the signal our listeners are hearing. Try to keep the levels at about 0dB on the readout; otherwise the signal sounds distorted to the listeners. (The sound you hear in the control room is not the actual signal going out over the air.) The FCC can fine a station for exceeding 100% of licensed output power more than six times in one minute (+1dB on our meters). So watch your levels carefully.Penalty: One warning to permanent dismissal.

__WMTU Rules__

The following rules are in-house only. You will not be hassled outside of Michigan Tech for violating these, but to the station they are equally as important as the FCC rules, and they have direct bearing on the current and future fate of your show.

__Bin  counts:__ Each time slot is required to count a certain amount of CD's per show. The CD's you are to count will be dictated by your DJ log. The CD counts are important to keep track of our CD library. If you don't do proper bin counts, you run the risk of being accused if any CD's are stolen. Penalty for not doing proper bin counts: Penalty: One warning to permanent dismissal.

__Programming  Logs:__ DJs are required by to keep a written record of the songs that they play. We need this record to see what music is being played, and it helps us track down missing CD's. Examples of program log entries are posted in the DJ booth. This may also be an asset in the event of a visit from the FCC. Penalty for not keeping log: One warning to permanent dismissal.

__Discrepancy  Log:__ While complete FCC compliance is the goal, we realize that mistakes do happen. What we want is a record of any mistakes, even the minor ones. For example, if you are playing a song you are not familiar with, that is not marked DNP, and the song contains an obscenity, you have two things to do. First, activate the 6 second delay to avoid the offending word from reaching the air waves. Next, write the offensive track number in the orange dot on the CD cover. If the discrepancy does make it to the air waves, then fill out the word, your name, and whether or not the track was previously marked "Do Not Play" (DNP) We will not use the discrepancy log to judge you as a DJ, so please be accurate. There will however, be repercussions if a violation is made and there is no record of it on the log. Penalty for not keeping an accurate Discrepancy Log: One warning to permanent dismissal.

__Booth supervision:__ DJ's are not allowed to leave the station in a manner which does not provide for the continued operation and care of the station.

DJ's will be held responsible for the actions of their guests, this includeds there behavior in Wadsworth Hall, Studios, and Airwaves. . Feel free to order anyone to leave if you think they may cause any damage or are just annoying you to the point where you cannot concentrate. The only people you can't order out are staff members performing necessary station business, like staff performing repairs or diagnostics on the equipment. If staffers are just hanging out and being a nuisance to you, they too can be ordered out. Be diplomatic. Penalty for having more than two guests: warning, to permanent dismissal, as well as referral to the Dean's Office and Public Safety

__Substitutes:__ If you need a substitute for your show, you must contact the Broadcast Supervisor at least three days before your show.

You may eat in the lobby, but you are responsible for any trash, spills, etc. Penalty for having food in the booth: Warning to Immediate and permanent dismissal.

__Suggestions to Make Your Show Great__

__Preparation:__ Before you even show up at the station, have an idea of the music you want to play. If you want, show up fifteen minutes early and pick out your first 10 to 15 songs (just be sure the DJ before you has done his bin counts first). During your show, try to stay a couple of songs ahead of what you are playing. Before you go on the mic, know what you are going to say. If you want to mention what you have just played, have the program log in front of you so you don't have to stammer on the air while looking for the cd case (A good reason to keep the program log accurate).

__Format:__ In order to maintain continuity within their show, DJ's are urged to pick some sort of format. If you decide not to pick any specific genre, at least try to pick your songs so that they do not clash (e.g. don't play Clutch right after Ten Thousand Maniacs).

__Promos/intros:__ Each radio show will have its own promo slot that will be made during the first week of each term. These promo's will be played during the last half hour of the previous show to introduce what is coming up next on . Other promo's may be scheduled during your radio show to promote other shows or 's format.

__Air breaks:__ Contrary to what some DJ's believe, the listening audience rarely tunes in to listen to the DJ talk, especially if he is talking about things nobody else cares about. At the same time, it's a bit annoying when a DJ only talks at the top of the hour. A good rule of thumb is to get on the mic every four or five songs. Try to keep the monologue from getting too personal.

__Requests:__ DJs are encouraged to play requests, since that tends to give the listeners some input as to what's played. However, some requests are best left unplayed. For example, if a listener requests Simon and Garfunkle during a formatted Metal slot, politely inform the requester that it won't fit your format. If a request fits your format but you can't stand the song, tell the requester that you'll try to find it, or that you're backed up with requests, or something. Do not insult the listeners taste on the phone and especially not on the air. As always, be diplomatic!

__Random points  of interest:__

*   2-disk sets count as 1 when doing bin counts
*   If your have a comment for the staff, put a note  in the department head's mailbox
*   Do not move the mike boom while on the air
*   Run your vocal levels a few dB's higher than  your music
*   Have a song or mini disc cued up at all times, in case the unexpected happens ( e.g. you find an obscenity, you lose the program on the CD player, etc. )
*   Don't beg for requests
*   Don't use DJ jargon ( e.g. PSA's, promos, DNP,  etc.)
